 @brief BTPayPalDriver enables you to obtain permission to charge your customers' PayPal accounts via app switch to the PayPal app and the browser.

 @note To make PayPal available, you must ensure that PayPal is enabled in your Braintree control panel.
 See our [online documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/ios+ruby/guides/paypal) for
 details.

 @discussion This class supports two basic use-cases: Vault and Checkout. Each of these involves variations on the
 user experience as well as variations on the capabilities granted to you by this authorization.

 The *Vault* option uses PayPal's future payments authorization, which allows your merchant account to
 charge this customer arbitrary amounts for a long period of time into the future (unless the user
 manually revokes this permission in their PayPal control panel.) This authorization flow includes
 a screen with legal language that directs the user to agree to the terms of Future Payments.
 Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to collect shipping information in the Vault flow.

 The *Checkout* option creates a one-time use PayPal payment on your behalf. As a result, you must
 specify the checkout details up-front, so that they can be shown to the user during the PayPal flow.
 With this flow, you must specify the estimated transaction amount, and you can collect shipping
 details. While this flow omits the Future Payments agreement, the resulting payment method cannot be
 stored in the vault. It is only possible to create one Braintree transaction with this form of user
 approval.

 Both of these flows are available to all users on any iOS device. If the PayPal app is installed on the
 device, the PayPal login flow will take place there via an app switch. Otherwise, PayPal login takes
 place in the Safari browser.

 Regardless of the type or target, all of these user experiences take full advantage of One Touch. This
 means that users may bypass the username/password entry screen when they are already logged in.

 Upon successful completion, you will receive a `BTPayPalAccountNonce`, which includes user-facing
 details and a payment method nonce, which you must pass to your server in order to create a transaction
 or save the authorization in the Braintree vault (not possible with Checkout).

 ## User Experience Details

 To keep your UI in sync during app switch authentication, you may set a delegate, which will receive
 notifications as the PayPal driver progresses through the various steps necessary for user
 authentication.

 ## App Switching Details

 This class will handle switching out of your app to the PayPal app or the browser (including the call to
 `-[UIApplication openURL:]`).
