 @brief Collects device data using Kount and PayPal.

 @discussion This method collects device data using both Kount and PayPal. If you want to collect data for Kount,
 use `-collectCardFraudData`. To collect data for PayPal, integrate PayPalDataCollector and use
 `[PPDataCollector collectPayPalDeviceData]`.

 For lifecycle events such as a completion callback, use BTDataCollectorDelegate. Although you do not need
 to wait for the completion callback before performing the transaction, the data will be most effective if you do.
 Normal response time is less than 1 second, and it should never take more than 10 seconds.

 We recommend that you call this method as early as possible, e.g. at app launch. If that's too early,
 calling it e.g. when the customer initiates checkout should also be fine.

 Store the return value as deviceData to use with debit/credit card transactions on your server,
 e.g. with `Transaction.sale`.
